# [vue-router] Named Route 'departments' has a default child route. When navigating to this named route (:to="{name: 'departments'"), the default child route will not be rendered. Remove the name from this route and use the name of the default child route for named links instead.

  **解决方法：** 将父级路由的 name 属性删除
